    "### What is Dremio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dremio is an open-source, distributed analytics engine designed for high-performance analytics on data lakes. It provides a simple, self-service interface for data exploration, transformation, and collaboration. Dremio's architecture is built on top of Apache Arrow, a high-performance columnar memory format, and leverages the Parquet file format for efficient storage. By combining these technologies, Dremio enables users to query data from various sources, including Hadoop, NoSQL databases, and cloud storage, without the need for data movement or copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why Dremio has gained popularity among data professionals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-service data exploration and transformation**: Dremio empowers data analysts and scientists to explore, clean, and transform data using SQL or visual interfaces. This self-service model reduces the burden on IT teams and speeds up the data analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unified data access**: Dremio connects to a wide range of data sources, allowing users to query data from multiple systems simultaneously. This unified access simplifies data management and promotes collaboration between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High-performance queries**: By leveraging Apache Arrow and columnar storage, Dremio delivers fast query performance on large datasets. Additionally, it employs advanced techniques like predicate pushdown and column pruning to optimize queries further.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalability**: Dremio's distributed architecture can scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes and concurrent user workloads. This scalability ensures that Dremio can handle the demands of even the largest enterprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security and governance**: Dremio supports robust security features, including data access controls, encryption, and integration with enterprise security solutions like LDAP and Active Directory. These features help organizations maintain compliance and protect sensitive data"

    "## Setup Dremio OSS in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy Dremio in a Kubernetes cluster, we can use Helm charts. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps us to deploy, manage, and upgrade applications in a Kubernetes cluster. Helm charts provide a set of templates and configurations that define how an application should be deployed in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we will use the Dremio OSS (Open Source Software) image to deploy 1 Master, 3 Executors and 3 Zookeepers. The Master node is responsible for coordinating the cluster, while the Executors are responsible for processing the data. By deploying multiple Executors, we can parallelize the data processing and improve the performance of our cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To store the data in a distributed manner, we will use MinIO bucket as the distributed storage. MinIO is a high-performance, distributed object storage system that is designed for cloud-native applications. Whenever new files are uploaded to Dremio, they will be stored in the MinIO bucket. This allows us to store and process large amounts of data in a scalable and distributed manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "To Follow the instructions in the Notebook below you will need,\n",
    "* A Kubernetes cluster. You can use Minikube to set up a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine\n",
    "* Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes. You can follow this guide to install Helm on your machine.\n",
    "* A MinIO server running on bare metal or kubernetes. You can follow [this](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/installation.html#install-and-deploy-minio) guide to install MinIO on bare metal or [this](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html) guide to install MinIO on Kubernetes or you can use [play server](https://play.min.io/) for testing purposes.\n",
    "* A MinIO client (mc) to access the MinIO server. You can follow [this](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html) guide to install mc on your machine.\n",
